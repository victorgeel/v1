- [iodine](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine) - This is a piece of software that lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed.
- [obfuscated-openssh](https://github.com/brl/obfuscated-openssh) - Handshake obfuscation strengthens the initial SSH handshake against systems that identify or classify various network protocols by examining data in transit for static signatures.
- [infranet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/infranet/) - Infranet is a system that attempts to circumvent web censorship by allowing clients to surreptitiously request sensitive content via cooperating Web servers distributed across the global Internet.
- [fwlite](https://github.com/v3aqb/fwlite) - A powerful HTTP proxy server designed to circumvent the Great Firewall (GFW)
- [code-talker-tunnel](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/CodeTalkerTunnel.html) - Code Talker Tunnel (previously called SkypeMorph) is a protocol camouflaging tool, designed to reshape traffic output of any censorship circumvention tool to look like Skype video calls
- [stegotorus](https://sri-csl.github.io/stegotorus/) - StegoTorus, a tool that comprehensively disguises Tor from protocol analysis. To foil analysis of packet contents, Tor’s traffic is steganographed to resemble an innocuous cover protocol, such as HTTP.
